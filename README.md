### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Shivangi Sharma
Developer | Data Engineer | Open-source Enthusiast | MERN Stack Specialist

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I am a passionate developer and data engineer with a strong focus on MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack development. I love building scalable and performant applications that leverage the power of modern technologies.

ðŸ’» As a MERN stack specialist, I have hands-on experience in developing robust back-end APIs, building dynamic front-end interfaces, and designing efficient databases. I'm skilled in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have a solid understanding of data modeling, RESTful architectures, and deployment strategies.

ðŸ“Š I'm also a data enthusiast who enjoys working with large datasets, designing data pipelines, and implementing data-driven solutions. I'm familiar with data warehousing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

ðŸŒ± As an open-source enthusiast, I try to contribute to the developer community by sharing my knowledge and collaborating on exciting projects. I believe in the power of open-source software to drive innovation and improve the lives of developers worldwide.

ðŸš€ On GitHub, you'll find my personal projects, open-source contributions, and experiments with cutting-edge technologies. I'm a strong advocate for clean code, best practices, and continuous learning.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! If you're interested in collaborating on MERN stack projects, discussing data engineering challenges, or engaging in open-source initiatives, feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or [insert preferred contact method]. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and work on meaningful projects.

Let's build innovative solutions, harness the power of data, and contribute to the open-source community together! âœ¨
